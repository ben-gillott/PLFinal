Summary:
The main goal of this project is to help enforcing typing when dealing with numbers
and vectors framed in a computer graphics context. It will help by allowing the user
to manually define the type(s) of an Integer or Vector expression, and then enforce that
only expressions that are operating on values of the same type(s) can be executed.

Strengths: 
I really like the concept behind this project, I have dealt with the confusions
of subtle computer graphics bugs and appreciate how helpful a type system such
as this could be. Secondly, I really like how the use can define the type of the
value/expression as it provides more flexibility and adaptability to the typing system.

Suggestions: 
I think the project is going down a good path, especially with the allowing of
multiple tags. One suggeston for a system with multiple tags is that it may be
good to have an idea of a type heirarchy. Otherwise it may be cumbersome to check
multiple types at once. This would also lead to a smooth transition to including subtyping,
which would also be a very interesting feature. One example that could be interesting
to think about in this context would be how to handle two values with cartesian and
homogenous coordinate types and how the type checking should occur.
